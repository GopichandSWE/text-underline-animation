The text underline animation:
  The underline of the text will be spread from the center to the both ends.
  if we want to change the place from where the line to be started then use the "transform-origin" property.
  eg: transform-origin: left;   // the line starts from left and ends at right.
  eg: transform-origin: right;  // the line starts from right and ends at left.
  eg: transfrom-origin: center; // the line starts from the center of the text and spread to the end of the both sides.
